    "I'm a software engineer and AI researcher with a Master's in Computer Science from UMBC. My work spans machine learning research, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack development—always with a focus on building systems that are reliable, scalable, and production-ready.",
    "At UMBC, I developed a multimodal lie-detection system combining EEG signals and visual data, achieving 89% classification accuracy. At Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM, I automated infrastructure workflows, optimized AWS deployments, and built log analysis utilities that accelerated debugging for enterprise applications.",
    "I approach engineering with a product mindset: understand the problem, ship incrementally, measure impact, and iterate. Whether it's fine-tuning LLMs with QLoRA, building AI-powered agents, or deploying containerized applications—I care about clarity, maintainability, and real-world results.",
